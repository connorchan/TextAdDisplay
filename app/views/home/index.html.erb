			  	<h4>What is this?</h4>
				<p>When agencies communicate with clients, it's often difficult to convey through words
					what a new advertising campaign is going to look like visually. What exactly is a
					Google text ad? What are promoted tweets and Facebok news feed posts? What are
					the components of each? AdShow helps to make the answers to these questions come alive.</p>
			  </div>
			  <div class="col-md-4">
			  	<h4>What have we done?</h4>
				<p>We're trying to bridge the gap between PPC agencies and their clients. AdShow takes the 
					data and creative from your Twitter, Facebook, and AdWords Search Network campaigns and gives you back
					a fleshed-out, visual preview of how your ads will ultimately appear in the wild. Simply upload one
					of our accepted CSV templates to begin.</p>
